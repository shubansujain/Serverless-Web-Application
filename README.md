Steps to Build the Project:
Create a DynamoDB table to store the items. \
Build a Lambda function to handle the CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table. \
Use S3 to store and host the web application's static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). \
Create a CloudFront distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency. \
Expected Outcome:
Upon completing the project, you will have a working serverless web application hosted on AWS.
You will have hands-on experience building a serverless application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront.
Additionally, you will have experience working with AWS services and integrating them to build a complete solution.

This project will help you improve your skills in cloud computing, serverless architecture, and AWS services.
